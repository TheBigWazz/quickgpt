# quickgpt
A simple python window to display ChatGPT, created with ChatGPT and no Python experience.

I can't get the website JS to get permission to write to the clipboard, so for now the 'Copy Code' buttons do not work, you'll need to manually highlight and right click text.

I use PyInstaller with --windowed and -F to create a standalone .exe file.
